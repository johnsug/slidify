# slidify

The R [Slidify](http://slidify.org/) package is fantastic for making HTML5 slides using R Studio, but its documentation could use some improvement. This repo contains a revealjs slide deck I put together, so that I don't have to re-invent the wheel each time I come back to slidify and revealjs
